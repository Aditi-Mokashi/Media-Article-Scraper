Headline - Exclusive: Ukraine must adapt to a reduction in Western military aid, embattled army chief says
Short Description - In his article, Ukraine's army chief said an end to “outdated, stereotypical thinking” was needed to help modern armies win wars.
Article - Kyiv CNN  — Ukraine’s embattled army chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, says Ukraine must adapt to a reduction in military aid from its key allies and focus ever more strongly on technology if it is to win its war against Russia. In an exclusive essay for CNN, submitted amidst a swirl of rumors surrounding his future, Zaluzhnyi also addressed the challenge of mass mobilization, a source of tension between himself and President Volodymyr Zelensky. The general’s article makes no reference to his relationship with the president, nor to reports Zelensky is poised to announce his dismissal after four years in the job, a move a source said could come within days. Instead, the military commander seeks to build on an argument in an essay published three months ago, in addition to commenting for the first time on a series of political setbacks at home and abroad. Valery ZaluzhnyGeneral Staff of the Armed Forces ofUkraine Related article Ukraine’s army chief: The design of war has changed In that first essay, published in the Economist, Zaluzhnyi highlighted the importance of unmanned aerial vehicles and electronic warfare capabilities, as a priority for Ukraine, before concluding, “New innovative approaches can turn this war of position into one of maneuver.” Zaluzhnyi’s characterization of the situation as a war of position – one defined by attrition and a lack of movement on the battlefield – amounted to a recognition that the Ukrainian counteroffensive, launched to great fanfare earlier in 2023, was effectively over. Expectations earlier in the year were high that Ukraine could go on the attack and drive forward, conducting a war of maneuver to recapture significant amounts of territory lost to Russia in 2022. But deep Russian minefields and heavy Russian artillery fire, along with the rapid proliferation of First-Person-View (FPV) drones across the frontlines, making stealth attacks much harder, proved difficult to overcome. In the south, the primary focus of the effort, Ukrainian forces advanced about 20 kilometers; the hope had been they might be able to make it all the way to the coast, about 70 kilometers away. When Zaluzhny - in a separate interview at the same time - referred to the situation as a ‘stalemate,’ Zelensky’s office snapped, saying such talk only helped Russia.

Now, though, he clearly believes Ukraine’s military leaders must take account of a series of disappointments and distractions away from the battlefield as well. Indirectly, he references the failure of the United States to agree a new military aid package for Ukraine, as well as the fact that developments in the Middle East since October have drawn international attention elsewhere. In addition, “the weakness of the international sanctions’ regime means Russia … is still able to deploy its military-industrial complex in pursuit of a war of attrition against us.” He does not say it in as many words, but the article seems to suggest a growing sense that, ultimately, Ukraine’s fate is in its own hands. An attitude of self-help is not new in Ukraine, of course. It has prioritized its home-grown drone industry, for instance, notching up successes both in its sea drone program, striking Russian naval targets in the Black Sea, and with its long-range aerial drones, flying hundreds of kilometers to hit sites in and around Russia’s largest cities. But domestic problems are clearly a concern, as when Zaluzhnyi references the apparent reluctance of his political masters in Kyiv to get fully behind his call for greater mobilization for up to half a million draftees, an acknowledgment of Russia’s overwhelmingly superior troop numbers. “We must acknowledge the significant advantage enjoyed by [Russia] in mobilizing human resources and how that compares with the inability of state institutions in Ukraine to improve the manpower levels of our armed forces without the use of unpopular measures,” he writes. In a society possibly reluctant to put large numbers of young men and women directly in harm’s way, remote-controlled drones provide a more acceptable type of combat operation, as he acknowledges. Technology, he writes at one point, “boasts an undoubted superiority over tradition.” But its importance goes much further, he says, as he sets out his belief that unmanned aerial vehicles, along with other high-tech capabilities have revolutionized not just combat operations but the overall approach to strategy, too. Only an end to “outdated, stereotypical thinking” can help modern armies achieve victory in war, he writes. Read Valerii Zaluzhnyi’s full essay here.

Headline - Analysis: What to make of the US retaliation strikes against pro-Iranian militias in Iraq and Syria
Short Description - President Joe Biden salutes after attending the dignified transfer of the remains of three US service members killed in the drone attack on the US military outpost in Jordan, in Dover, Delaware, on February 2.
Article - CNN  — It was meant to sound devastating, and likely felt so to the pro-Iranian militias on the receiving end. But Friday night’s airstrikes against over 80 targets inside Iraq and Syria were — so far — a comparatively limited response to the worst loss of US military life in the region in nearly three years. Friday night tried to sound loud, but will likely not echo for long. US Central Command said the US deployed heavy bombers — the B-1B Lancer — to hit 85 targets in seven locations. The strikes may be determined to have caused more damage when the sun rises. But it was far from the most pain the Pentagon was capable of delivering. There might be more; US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin suggested this was the beginning. But on Friday, the US response lasted just 30 minutes, the White House said. It was short, perhaps sharp, but not a shock. That was a clear and calculated choice. The Biden administration faced a near-impossible task: Hit hard enough to show you mean it, but also ensure your opponent can absorb the blow without lashing out in return. The US had telegraphed its response for over five days, with senior US officials briefing about its nature, its severity, and even hinting at its targets. This warning was likely designed to reduce the risk of misunderstanding, and perhaps enable the militias targeted to shift locations, and lessen the loss of life. It may have also been intended to ensure US strikes were not mistaken for the work of Israel, which could have sparked retaliation against the Israelis and risked another cycle of escalation. In this March 2022 photo, the Pentagon is seen from Air Force One as it flies over Washington, DC.Patrick Semansky/AP Related article US carries out retaliatory strikes on Iranian-linked militia targets in Iraq and Syria This volatility reduced Biden’s options to a sliver of US capabilities. When his predecessor Donald Trump had Iran’s most senior military figure, Quds Force Commander Qasem Soleimani, killed in 2020, the region was far from the brink. But the risk of conflagration in 2024 is the highest it has been in decades. Mistakes, or unanticipated successes, can lead to spirals, and that can lead to unavoidable, wider conflict. It is almost miraculous that wider conflict has not already erupted in the Middle East four months after Palestinian militant group Hamas’ attack on Israel, and the ongoing assault on Gaza it sparked. (Indeed, you might be left asking, if recent months have not been enough for the Palestinians’ prima facie allies to intervene, what would be?) Yet as of Friday, despite a continuing slow boil of tensions between the US, its allies, and Iran’s many proxies, a wider war still remains unlikely. Wars normally happen in the rare event that both sides want them, or in the more common occasion when parties determine open conflict is unavoidable, or sometimes when they have run out of diplomatic space. Or they stumble into them through a wild spiral of escalation. Neither Iran nor the United States want a war. The Biden administration has elections looming, in which it does not need another costly foreign adventure, trouble over its Israel policy, or rising oil prices. Iran’s economy is still shaky, internal unrest is a not-yet distant memory, and it has wider goals of outsized regional influence, milking its technical relationship with Moscow, and the apparent pacy pursuit of a nuclear weapon.President Joe Biden and Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III attend the dignified transfer of the remains of Army Reserve Sergeants William Rivers, Kennedy Sanders and Breonna Moffett at Dover Air Force Base in Dover, Delaware, on February 2.Joshua Roberts/ReutersIt is for this crisis — seldom spoken of, but loud in the background noise — that perhaps Tehran and Washington are happy to save their direct confrontation. Since October 7, Iran increased its enrichment of uranium to over 83%, bolstering fears it was closing in on the nuclear bomb capability it insists it does not want. The UN watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency has suggested that Iranian uranium enrichment may have slowed in recent weeks, but the prospect of nuclear proliferation is again closer. In the meantime, Washington is happy to leave this looming crisis off its talking points. And Tehran is content with needling its main adversaries, fixing its internal woes, and avoiding broader conflict. There will likely follow criticism of the Biden administration for not using the same blunt and forceful approach of Trump in 2020. Yet the perception that might is the only means of projecting strength is dangerous. The US can inflict a lot of damage, anywhere it seeks, at any time. Biden’s decision so far to not send many other Americans to die in a wider conflict, in the name of avenging the deaths of three of their comrades, is not weakness, but the recognition that power is defined by its measured use. His critics would do well to remember that Trump’s bold killing of Soleimani did not stop us getting to this point.

Short Description - Jharkhand Governor C P Radhakrishnan is yet to invite the JMM-led alliance to form the government. Champai Soren claimed the support of 47 MLAs of the JMM-led alliance, which also includes the Congress and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD
Article - Jharkhand Governor C P Radhakrishnan on Thursday invited Champai Soren to form the government in the state, a day after the resignation of Hemant Soren. Champai Soren will take oath as Jharkhand CM on February 2 and the floor test will take place in the next 10 days, said Alamgir Alam, Leader of Congress Legislative Party(CLP) in Jharkhand Assembly. Meanwhile, the plan of JMM-led coalition MLAs to fly to Hyderabad from Ranchi amid a political crisis in Jharkhand was cancelled as the chartered planes hired for it could not take off due to poor visibility, sources said. Leaders of the coalition said that shifting the legislators to Hyderabad was needed to prevent any poaching attempt by the BJP. Hyderabad is the capital of Telangana which is governed by the Congress, a constituent of the coalition. The MLAs who waited for around two hours at the airport are returning to the Circuit House, where they had been staying. Jharkhand Congress president Rajesh Thakur said, “We are going to the airport. You know what kind of people they are, they can do anything anytime. A total of 43 MLAs are going…” At least 38 MLAs are set to move to the Congress-ruled state. Arrangments have been made in Begumpet for their stay. The legislative party members chose Soren’s aide, Champai Soren for the chief minister’s post, who staked his claim to form the government before Jharkhand Governor C P Radhakrishnan on Wednesday. The Jharkhand Governor, however, is yet to invite the JMM-led alliance to form the government. Champai Soren claimed the support of 47 MLAs of the JMM-led alliance, which also includes the Congress and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). Champai Soren on Thursday said, “We have demanded from the Governor that the process to start the formation of the new Government should begin. The Governor has also assured us that the process will begin soon. Currently we have submitted the report with 43 MLAs in our support. We expect that the number will reach 46-47 so there is no problem. Our ‘gathbandhan’ is very strong…” According to a Hindustan Times report, a JMM leader said a chartered flight was being arranged to shift the legislators to Hyderabad in Congress-ruled Telangana. “The southern city has been chosen because it is in a Congress-ruled state besides being closer to Ranchi than other possible destinations such as Bengaluru. It would take a shorter time to bring them back whenever required,” the leader was quoted by Hindustan Times as saying on the condition of anonymity. On the other hand, Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi rained down on Radhakrishnan accusing him of delaying the appointment of the new chief minister despite the JMM-led alliance having a clear majority. He also pointed out no delay was made in the swearing-in of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar after returning to the BJP-led alliance in Bihar.

Headline -  Cong MP DK Suresh Under Fire for 'Separate Southern Nation' Remark, Siddaramaiah Says 'You Can't Ask...'
Short Description - DK Suresh said the injustice is meted out to the southern states in tax distribution while the tax money is distributed to North India
Article - Calling himself a ‘proud Indian’, Congress MP DK Suresh has issued a clarification for his “separate country for South India” remark, saying the intention behind his statement was to bring to notice the “injustice in funds distribution” by the BJP-led central government. DK Suresh landed on soup over an alleged warning of a separate southern nation while attacking the centre on releasing funds for Southern states after Union Budget 2024 was presented in Parliament on Thursday. The statement has invited severe criticism from the BJP. The Bangalore Rural MP said the injustice is meted out to the southern states in tax distribution while the tax money is distributed to North India. “Our tax money is being distributed to north India, if we don’t condemn it there might arise a situation where we will have to demand for a separate nation,” DK Suresh said while responding to a question on the Interim Budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Lok Sabha today. The Karnataka Congress leader alleged that the southern states are not getting their proper share of tax return and added that injustice is caused to the southern states by the Hindi speaking states. However, later in the day, the Congress leader posted a thread on X (formerly Twitter) clarifying his remarks. “A proud Indian and a proud Kannadiga! South India and especially Karnataka have faced the brutality of injustice in funds distribution. Even after being the 2nd largest GST-contributing state, the Centre has been utterly unjust to Karnataka and Southern states while states like Gujarat have seen a 51 per cent hike. If this is not injustice, then what is?” he asked. The BJP lashed out at the Congress for “hatching a dangerous plot to partition India yet again.” “Faced with constant rejection by Indians, Congress is now seeding secessionism. Following Nehru’s legacy, Karnataka Deputy CM @DKShivakumar’s brother, @DKSureshINC demands a separate country,” the BJP attacked the Congress MP on X. “If Congress leaders do not wish to live in India, they are more than welcome to quit India and move to their ‘Motherland’ Italy,” the saffron party added. Karnataka Chief Minister CM Siddaramaiah, responding to Suresh’s remark, said one cannot ask for a separate nation for all this. Siddaramaiah, who is also from the Congress, added, “In a federal state you can ask for what belongs to you, but not for a separate nation.”

Headline - As Facebook turns 20, I have something to confess
Short Description - Facebook was founded 20 years ago today. Once a social platform for college students, it now has more than 3 billion users.
Article - Story highlightsFacebook was founded on February 4, 2004 Like many users, Thomas Lake has complicated feelings about Facebook But he sees his Facebook feed as a living journal of his lifeCNN  — Facebook turns 20 years old today, and if you don’t like it, I’m sure you have your reasons. The numerous scandals. The loss of privacy. The time it drains away from other, better activities. And on and on. But I’ve been thinking about the role Facebook has played in my life, and I’ve come to a realization. I hesitate to share this status update, this decidedly uncool confession, but I’m going to, eventually. Just let me work up to it. Last Friday I found myself scrolling down toward the beginning of my timeline. It took a long time to get there, even though I joined the party relatively late. On September 23, 2007, a friend wrote on my wall, “Welcome to Facebook. Finally.” By then some of the youngsters had already left, but it all felt new and exciting to me. I was 27, and I remember the strange thrill of tagging your friends in a picture. Or better yet, being tagged. There was a lot of work involved, with the digital camera and the unwieldy cable and the uploading and whatnot, but eventually I posted the pictures from that one epic Halloween party. I dressed as Jonathan the YouTube Zombie, which confused some of my early Facebook friends. “I like turtles,” I wrote, by way of explanation. As hundreds of millions of others joined, Facebook began to change the world, for better and worse. My future boss wrote a viral story titled “The 12 most annoying Facebookers.” I was probably several of them at one time or another: mysteriously “waiting for a sign,” or “pondering the meaning of Donnie Darko,” or shamelessly promoting the stories I’d written. But my list of friends grew. In 2009, roughly 40 of them wrote on my wall to wish me happy birthday. About the same number congratulated me later that year, when I told Facebook I was going to be a dad. As I got older and had children, the tenor of my posts evolved Now the posts shifted away from concerts and parties, and toward the ramblings of the domesticated. I loaded the dishwasher twice in one evening. I wandered the grocery store, “too hungry and confused to know what to buy.” My daughter was born, and one afternoon I somehow changed two diapers in the span of two minutes. That year, 2010, more than 50 people wished me happy birthday. This, it turned out, was Peak Happy Birthday. Such greetings became less common on Facebook after that, at least for me. Maybe the novelty wore off. We were all tired of something. On September 23, 2011, I wrote this status update: Groggy wife, referring to my persistent alarm clock: “I’ll throw it in the river. I don’t know what river, but I’ll find one.”Courtesy Thomas LakeAnother child was born. My children began talking, which led to my new favorite genre of Facebook post: Cute Thing My Kid Said. My daughter strung together her first five-word sentence. “I need more too, Mama.” She was talking about a doughnut. Other random kids said cute things, too, and these also became Facebook posts. At the park, a seven-year-old girl started talking to me about my daughter. “What kind of girl will she be?” this outgoing youngster asked me. “Sports? Lazy? I’m sports. Fashionable? Playing girl, which not sports? Running girl? There are different types of girls.” The next year only six people wrote on my timeline for my birthday. One was my wife’s sister, Jill: Happy Birthday, Bro-in-Law! Hope it’s GREAT! :) Another son was born. I memorialized his arrival in a Facebook post but did not say he was fighting for his life in intensive care. He got well and came home, but 2015 was still a hard year. One day I posted some Bruce Springsteen lyrics: Everything dies Baby, that’s a fact But maybe everything that dies Someday comes back I posted this mysterious status update, firmly in the role of the annoying Facebooker known as The Obscurist, but I was too ashamed to tell the story behind it: I’d just lost my job at Sports Illustrated, and my confidence was so shaken that I didn’t know if I’d be able to write again. Eventually I landed at CNN, following the presidential campaign. In 2016, as we planned a family trip to Disney World, Jill was one of a handful of people who wrote on my wall: HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BRO-IN-LAW!!!!!! I shall buy you a Mickey ice cream bar soon!!!!!! :)Juliana ElliottA decade into the Facebook experiment, I was posting less and less. Memories began popping up automatically, old pictures from years past, and I resurfaced them with new comments and new hearts. In 2019 only one person wrote on my timeline for my birthday. I heard a song by the Goo Goo Dolls in the grocery store, which led to a rare status update: what if you wrote a song that said “a tired song keeps playing on a tired radio” and then 25 years later your song became the tired song that keeps playing on the tired radio The coronavirus pandemic brought an upsurge in Facebook activity as we huddled in our homes and wondered what was happening out there. We sent out encouragement to the brave healthcare workers and paid tribute to departed musicians with virtual concerts on Facebook Live. That July I had my 40th birthday. Jill did not write on my wall. She had died two days earlier, at age 39, after an illness that led to a pulmonary embolism. As its best, Facebook is a digital museum As I write this in early February, I have yet to post anything on Facebook in 2024. I don’t know why, exactly. Too busy, perhaps, or too lazy. But this is my confession about Facebook: If given the chance, I would join all over again. Yes, I am grateful for Facebook. I’ve never consistently kept a journal, so Facebook is one of the closest things I have to a contemporaneous record of my life. And in some ways it’s better than a journal, because it has pictures and videos and annotations from my friends.A mural decorates one of the many open work areas at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California.Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty ImagesAt its best, Facebook is a digital museum, a repository for the milestones of life. It has made party invitations a lot easier — and helped me find some good Ultimate Frisbee games. It has connected me with old friends and classmates and relatives who otherwise might have remained disconnected. It has helped preserve my memories of several very dear people who, like Jill, have since passed away. Facebook friendship is no substitute for real-life friendship, and someone else’s Facebook pictures are no substitute for your own experience. But at times, Facebook has helped me appreciate real life more deeply. On November 9, 2021, as new coronavirus variants forced us back into isolation, I asked my friends, “What’s a small thing that makes you happy?’” The post got 85 comments. People gave thanks for cozy blankets and a fire, hideous fuzzy socks, the smell of leather boots, an empty dishwasher, a cup of hot chocolate, a cold beer after a good run, autumn leaves at golden hour, reading books in the evening before bed. “The excited way my dog looks at me in the morning,” my neighbor Cheryl wrote. “‘Oh boy! We get to do this all over again?” It was an outpouring of gratitude, a celebration of life. Online, yes, but real, and satisfying. Like an orange sunrise. A frosted windowpane. A silent alarm clock on a Sunday morning.

Headline - Pigeon suspected of spying for China released in India after PETA intervention, group says
Short Description - The pigeon is released in Mumbai.
Article - CNN  — A pigeon suspected of spying for China and held for eight months was released by Indian officials this week after intervention from animal rights organization PETA, the group said in a statement. “After learning that a pigeon was held at the Bai Sakarbai Dinshaw Petit Hospital for Animals (BSDPHA) in Parel as case property for an astonishing eight months, PETA India sprang into action to secure the bird’s freedom from captivity,” PETA said. The animal’s ordeal began in May last year, when it was captured near a port in Mumbai. There was a message written on the pigeon’s wings in words that appeared to be Chinese, PETA added. “This led to suspicion of spying and caused police to seize the bird, who was sent to Mumbai’s BSDPHA for a medical examination as part of an investigation.” CNN has reached out to Mumbai police for comment. Another pigeon was reportedly taken into custody in 2016 after authorities found it with a note that threatened Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In the most recent case, PETA contacted police in Mumbai “without further delay… to grant formal permission for the hospital to release the pigeon.” “The bird was released yesterday on the hospital premises by Colonel (Retd) Dr B. B. Kulkarni, Chief Medical Superintendent of the BSDPHA,” PETA said. Earlier Indian media reports had said that the bird had been transferred to the Bombay Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, whose doctors set it free on Tuesday. CNN has reached out to Bombay SPCA for comment. While the pigeon’s case has made global headlines, “spy animals” captured and exploited by militaries are nothing new. In 2019, a snowy white beluga whale, later nicknamed Hvaldimir, shot to international fame after it was spotted wearing a specially made harness with mounts for a camera, leading experts to suggest the whale may have been trained by the Russian military. Belugas are social animals that hunt and travel together in pods. Hvaldimir the whale was found alone, and has been known to follow boats and play with those on board. He resurfaced in Swedish waters in 2023 and there have been concerns expressed by animal rights activists and marine experts about his fate.

Headline -  Investing Across Borders: Benefits Of International Mutual Funds In A Portfolio
Short Description - Success in international investments requires careful consideration and a proactive approach to risk management.
Article - In today’s interconnected global economy, investors increasingly acknowledge the significance of diversification beyond domestic markets. While the Indian market continues to show robust growth, financial advisors are placing greater emphasis on the pivotal role of international mutual funds in the pursuit of comprehensive financial planning. Also Read: Dear Investor How Much Money Should You Invest In A Mutual Fund? The primary allure of international funds lies in their unique ability to offer geographic diversification. By strategically allocating a portion of a portfolio to companies operating in diverse countries, investors can effectively reduce the impact of regional economic downturns or market volatilities. This diversification acts as a robust risk management strategy, fundamentally enhancing the stability and resilience of the overall investment portfolio. Beyond the mitigation of regional risks, international funds provide investors with a valuable avenue to tap into global growth opportunities. While domestic markets undoubtedly present significant prospects, the international landscape offers a broader spectrum of growth possibilities. Investing in diverse regions, including emerging markets with substantial growth potential, allows investors to participate in the global economic success story. This exposure not only broadens the investment horizon but can also contribute to higher returns over the long term, complementing the performance of domestic holdings. An often underestimated advantage of investing internationally is the mitigation of currency risk. As international investments involve exposure to different currencies, they naturally introduce currency risk. However, this risk also presents an opportunity for savvy investors. International funds can serve as effective hedges against currency fluctuations, helping to offset potential losses resulting from unfavourable movements in the home currency. This aspect is particularly relevant for investors seeking to safeguard their portfolios against the impact of currency devaluation. This consideration adds an extra layer of risk management to the investment strategy. Furthermore, international portfolios act as a hedge against inflation, contributing to the overall resilience of an investment strategy. Investors gain access to economies with varying inflation rates, allowing them to strategically position their portfolios to protect against the eroding effects of inflation over time. For instance, investing in countries with lower inflation rates can be a prudent move to safeguard the real value of investments. Beyond risk management, international funds offer exposure to sectors and industries that may be underrepresented or absent in domestic markets. This diversification enables investors to capitalise on unique opportunities, such as investing in cutting-edge technologies, industries with higher growth potential, or companies with a global competitive edge. For example, while artificial intelligence and machine learning are gaining traction globally, there may be limited options in the domestic market. Investing in a fund that focuses on these technologies in international markets can potentially yield substantial returns. While the benefits of international funds are evident, investors must approach this strategy with diligence. Factors such as risk tolerance, investment goals, time horizon, and a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory environment, geographical factors, taxation, and economic conditions of target markets should guide decisions regarding fund allocation. In a nutshell, the importance of international funds in a portfolio cannot be overstated. Their role in providing diversification, access to global growth opportunities, mitigating currency risk, and enhancing portfolio resilience makes them an indispensable component of a well-rounded investment strategy. Success in international investments requires careful consideration and a proactive approach to risk management. Additionally, investors should be mindful of taxation implications to understand the potential returns comprehensively. In the dynamic and interconnected global market, international mutual funds stand as a powerful tool for investors seeking to diversify their portfolios and navigate the complexities of the international financial landscape. -The author is co-founder, Wealth Redefine.

Headline - Finance worker pays out $25 million after video call with deepfake ‘chief financial officer’
Short Description - Authorities are increasingly concerned at the damaging potential posed by artificial intelligence technology.
Article - CNN  — A finance worker at a multinational firm was tricked into paying out $25 million to fraudsters using deepfake technology to pose as the company’s chief financial officer in a video conference call, according to Hong Kong police. The elaborate scam saw the worker duped into attending a video call with what he thought were several other members of staff, but all of whom were in fact deepfake recreations, Hong Kong police said at a briefing on Friday. “(In the) multi-person video conference, it turns out that everyone [he saw] was fake,”senior superintendent Baron Chan Shun-ching told the city’s public broadcaster RTHK. Chan said the worker had grown suspicious after he received a message that was purportedly from the company’s UK-based chief financial officer. Initially, the worker suspected it was a phishing email, as it talked of the need for a secret transaction to be carried out. However, the worker put aside his early doubts after the video call because other people in attendance had looked and sounded just like colleagues he recognized, Chan said.Hong Kong's famous skyline.Dale De La Rey / AFP Believing everyone else on the call was real, the worker agreed to remit a total of $200 million Hong Kong dollars – about $25.6 million, the police officer added. The case is one of several recent episodes in which fraudsters are believed to have used deepfake technology to modify publicly available video and other footage to cheat people out of money. At the press briefing Friday, Hong Kong police said they had made six arrests in connection with such scams. Chan said that eight stolen Hong Kong identity cards – all of which had been reported as lost by their owners – were used to make 90 loan applications and 54 bank account registrations between July and September last year. On at least 20 occasions, AI deepfakes had been used to trick facial recognition programs by imitating the people pictured on the identity cards, according to police. The scam involving the fake CFO was only discovered when the employee later checked with the corporation’s head office.

Article - A team of the Delhi Police Crime Branch arrived at the Delhi Minister of Education, PWD, Culture and Tourism, Atishi Marlena’s house over AAP’s MLA poaching claim case. According to AAP sources, the minister was not present at her residence. She, however, directed her camp office to receive the notice. “The team will go again to serve notice to Atishi. This morning she was not present at her residence,” a senior officer of the Delhi Police Crime Branch was quoted by PTI as saying. Speaking about the notice served to her by the Delhi Police Crime branch earlier today, AAP leader Atishi said, “They gave notice to CM Kejriwal and me. This notice is neither FIR nor summons. No IPC, CRPC, and PMLA sections are mentioned in it.” The Delhi further stated that police said the “notice will be handed over to me only”. “We pity the Crime Branch people,” she added. The development comes after a team of the Delhi Police crime branch visited Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence on Saturday morning again to serve him a notice in connection with a probe over his claim that the BJP was trying to poach AAP MLA. On Friday evening too, Crime Branch teams visited the residences of Kejriwal and Delhi Minister Atishi. Last week, CM Arvind Kejriwal had alleged in an X post that the BJP offered Rs 25 crore each to seven AAP MLAs to quit the party while also threatening to topple the government in Delhi. Atishi had also accused the BJP of launching “Operation Lotus 2.0” in Delhi. “They had made a similar attempt to poach AAP MLAs last year by offering them money but failed,” she said at a press conference. Following the allegations, a delegation of the Delhi BJP on January 30 met the city police chief, seeking a probe into Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s allegations. Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva said, “We had said Kejriwal is levelling false allegations to create a sensation. The truth behind Kejriwal’s lie is about to be exposed now. He cannot lie and then run away from the probe. He will have to face the investigation.”

Headline -  GST Update: Tobacco Product Makers To Face Rs 1 Lakh Penalty If Packing Machines Not Registered
Short Description - The Finance Bill, 2024, introduced amendments to the Central GST Act, where a penalty of Rs 1 lakh would be levied for every machine not registered.
Article - Manufacturers of pan masala, gutka and similar tobacco products will have to pay a penalty of up to Rs 1 lakh, if they fail to register their packing machinery with the GST authorities with effect from April 1. The move is intended to curb revenue leakage in the tobacco manufacturing sector.

Further, such non-compliant machinery would face the risk of seizure and confiscation in certain cases. Based on the recommendation of the GST Council, the tax authorities had last year notified a special procedure for registration of machines by tobacco manufacturers. The details of existing packing machines, newly-installed machines, along with the packing capacity of these machines, have to be furnished in Form GST SRM-I. However, there was no penalty notified for the same. Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said the GST Council in an earlier meeting decided that for pan masala, gutka and similar products, there should be a registration of their machines so that we can keep a watch over their production capacity. “However, there were no penalties in case they failed to register. So the Council had decided that there should be some penalties. That’s why in the Finance bill you find penalty up to a lakh of rupees for not registering machines,” Malhotra told PTI. In February last year, the GST Council, chaired by the Union finance minister and comprising state counterparts, had approved the report of a panel of state finance ministers on plugging tax evasion in pan masala and gutkha businesses. The GoM (group of ministers) had recommended that the mechanism for levy of compensation cess on pan masala and chewing tobacco be changed from ad valorem to a specific rate-based levy to boost the first stage collection of the revenue. Following that, the government had brought in amendments to Finance Bill, 2023, as per which the GST compensation cess would be levied on pan masala and other forms of tobacco on the highest rate of their retail sale price.
